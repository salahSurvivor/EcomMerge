# EcommerceErp
This project was generated with Angular CLI version 15.1.2.

## How It Works
To get the application up and running, follow these steps:

1. **Install Project Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
2. **Install json-server Globally (Optional) If you don't have json-server installed globally, you can install it using:**
   ```bash
   npm install -g json-server

- Alternatively, if you prefer not to install it globally, you can skip this step and use it locally

3. **Serve the Angular Application**
    ```bash
    npx ng serve
- This will start the Angular development server and the application will be available at http://localhost:4200 by default.

4. **Run the JSON Server**
    ```bash
    npx json-server -w data/pcinfo.json
- This command will start the JSON server and watch for changes in the data/pcinfo.json file. By default, the JSON server will run on http://localhost:3000.

# Additional Information
- Make sure that you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
- Ensure that you have Angular CLI version 15.1.2 installed to avoid compatibility issues.

# Troubleshooting

- If you encounter any issues, verify that all dependencies are installed correctly and that the paths to your JSON data file are correct.
- Check that the ports used by both the Angular application and JSON server do not conflict.
